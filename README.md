Gemstone is a drawing API for the Minecraft mod [CC-Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc).

## Demos

Coming Soon!

## Documentation

Docs are currently ~~still semi-work-in-progress. Events aren't documented yet, Docs are now using Illuaminate!~~ offline, I'll get them back up soon!

## Contribution

Contributions are very welcome, and if you do make a PR to add a new element to the official repo, it must:

- Have adequate documentation
- Must be fairly-well optimized
- Maintain the design language between other elements in the API
- It must not be buggy!

Elements may also be rejected if they are considered redundant, or can be easily created using existing elements.

You may also submit your own themes, although they can't be absouletly hideous. No carnival funhouse themes please!

Tests may also be submitted, and must follow the same guidelines as the component guidelines, minus the documentation.

## Using in your project

Using Gemstone in your project is not currently reccomneded, as it is in beta and is still considered unstable, but if you want to, feel free to! Just refer to the license. TL;DR, you can use it however you want, as long as you give me credit.
